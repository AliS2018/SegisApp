# SegisDocs
More of a file manager for specific document uses. 
This app will eventually allow users to look up their clients through an old db like FoxPro *this app converts fox to sql and vice versa*, store are retreive files from any sources specified in their storage devices and so on and on.

If my brain allows me to create frameworks for or on Java I will also allow users to make this app as modular as possible so that they can add whatever the functionality they want

Local/Internal app to help view large amount of user data from a database-like document (.DBF/FoxPro)
For the time being, this is my very first java app, so it might present some errors and other bugs
